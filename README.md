# jenkinsTest

Or rather not anymore. This started out as a test of Jenkins, but now I am using it to test all sorts of weird stuff, that has nothing to do with any real project. For example, this edit is done to understand why my students insist on creating a new commit for every newline or minor edit they do. They seem to use commits as a kind of "save" function.

... And that is, of course, less than optimal when I am supposed to review their commits.
