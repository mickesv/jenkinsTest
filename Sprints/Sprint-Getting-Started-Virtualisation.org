* About This Sprint
  This sprint introduces a tool for virtualisation (VirtualBox), and a layer on top of this tool that enables automation (Vagrant).
* User Stories covered in this Sprint
  - As a developer I want to have a machine configuration locally accessible which is configured as closely as possible as the production environment so that I can test and mess up locally.
  - As a manager I want my developers to be able to test locally in a cheap way so that overall costs are kept down.

* Experiential Learning
** Install VirtualBox
1. Download VirtualBox for your machine: [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][Download VirtualBox]]
2. Read more about installation details here: [[https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html][VirtualBox User Manual, Chapter 2. Installation Details]]
3. Also download and install the *VirtualBox Extension Pack*
4. Download [[http://www.ubuntu.com/download][Ubuntu]]. Any version will do.
*** Create a Virtual Machine
1. Start VirtualBox
2. Create a new Virtual Machine

   [[./images/IVbox_tb.png]]

3. Give it a name, and select Linux/Ubuntu (64 bit)

   [[./images/IVbox_new.png]]

4. Click through all the other options with ~Continue~ and ~Create~ (it alternates)
5. Double click your newly created virtual machine. It will now ask you to select an install media.

   Click on the folder, select your downloaded ubuntu image, and then click on ~Start~

   You are now running the ubuntu installer in your virual machine. Install Ubuntu in your usual way.

*** Start/Pause/Stop your Virtual Machine
- Double-clicking on your VM in VirtualBox' UI will start your machine.
- CLosing the window will prompt you whether you want to pause the VM, shutdown nicely, or pull the plug.

  [[./images/IVbox_close.png]]

- The same options are also available by right-clicking your VM in the VirtualBox UI.

*** Summary
You have now installed VirualBox. You have created a new virtual machine, and have installed ubuntu on it.
** Install Vagrant
1. Make sure you have already installed VirtualBox
2. Download and install Vagrant for your machine: [[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html][Download Vagrant]]

*** Create a new Vagrant Virtual Machine (Box)
1. Create and enter a new directory, and then run ~vagrant init hashicorp/precise64~ to create a new configuration.

   This will create a stub ~Vagrantfile~ which contains the configuration for your virtual box.
   
2. Start your virtual machine with ~vagrant up~ and log in to it with ~vagrant ssh~.

   This will download (if necessary) a virtualbox Ubuntu image, start it for you, and make it available so that you can ssh into it.

3. Browse around. Note that the directory ~/vagrant~ is the same as your starting directory on your host computer.

*Summary of Commands:*
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ mkdir myVagrantTest && cd myVagrantTest
$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64   
$ vagrant up
[Lots of text here, telling you what Vagrant is up to]
$ vagrant ssh
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic-pae i686)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
New release '14.04.2 LTS' available.
Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

Welcome to your Vagrant-built virtual machine.

vagrant@precise32:~$ 
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_note
- Exit your Vagrant Virtual Machine as usual: ~exit~
- Remember to clean up after yourself: ~vagrant destroy -f~
#+END_note

- If you have VirtualBox running, you can see how machines are added and removed as a consequence of the ~up~ and ~destroy~ commands.
- To speed things up, you may wish to add a box (a virtual machine image) without attaching it to any particular configuration with ~vagrant box add hashicorp/precise64~

   This will download the image and store it for future use. There is a [[https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search][Catalogue]] of available virtual machine images available for Vagrant.

*** Summary
You have now installed Vagrant. You have downloaded a virtual machine image, started it, and logged in to it. After looking around, you have destroyed your virtual machine, thus leaving a clean slate for the next time you bring the machine up again.

Now would be a good idea to go back to the [[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/][Vagrant Tutorial]] and play around a bit more.
** Update Sprint Test Plan
    Go through the user stories for this sprint and make sure you have a clear understanding of how to solve each of them.

    Revisit and update your risks and contingencies section.

    Add and/or revise the following items to your glossary:
    - Host Operating System
    - Guest Operating System
    - Virtual Machine

    Make sure you understand what each item is, and how to use them either in isolation or together with the other concepts.    
** Update Course Backlog
- What can you use your virtual machine for?
- Can you start up your VM automatically?
- Can you start up your VM /without/ attaching a screen (and run it like a true server)?
- What if your desired environment consists of several machines?
- Can you install different software so that you may boot up specialised versions of your guest operating systems?

   Where do you go from here? Are there any questions that you want answered? Add them, along with a brief strategy for how to find an answer.   
* Sprint Acceptance Tests
  You are done with this sprint when you have:
  - Read the tutorials about VirtualBox and Vagrant
  - Installed VirtualBox
  - Created a virtual machine in VirtualBox
  - Installed an operating system on your virtual machine
  - Installed Vagrant
  - Created a Vagrant Box and logged in to it
  - Destroyed your started instance of a Vagrant Box

  You may also have:
   - Updated your Sprint Test Plan
   - Updated your Course Backlog
